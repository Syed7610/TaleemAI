## 📈 Model & Report Workflow

The end-to-end workflow is designed for full automation and reproducibility:

1. **Fetch Dataset** → Download from Kaggle via API or manual upload.  
2. **Preprocessing** → Data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.  
3. **Training** → Classification using algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression.  
4. **Evaluation** → Metrics include confusion matrix and classification report.  
5. **Visualization** → Performance graphs saved in the `/reports/` directory.  
6. **PDF Generation** → Automated report creation containing all results and visuals.  
7. **Automation** → GitHub Actions triggers retraining and reporting on every push.
